Installation

You will need two player squad files created, that were exported from one of
the squad builders.  These files must be named as follows:

player1.json - this is the squad file for player 1
player2.json - this is the squad file for player 2

Als you will need an empty file called  timer.txt.

Place these files in the same directory as the xstreamer-all.jar

Configuring the Application

You may want to update the location as to where the files are being output.

By default it will output everything to the same directory as the program was executed.

Configuration files reside in two location:

* config
* templates

Templates contains the FTL files used to generate the actual squads.  Two are included
as examples on how to generate player squad overlays.

Config contains the locations where the input files and output files reside.

The application includes many of the resources from the Vassal program, and these reside in the images
directory.  You may reference these in your squad templates.
