This will generate a text file that looks similar to the following for each ship in the squad

(4) Gamma Squadron Pilot #4 - 26
Extra Munitions
Assault Missiles, XX-23 S-Thread Tracers
Guidance Chips
HHHHHH*

If pilot skill values are entered, when a pilot is destroyed the skill will be replaced with an X

This makes use of several custom functions.

findUpgrade - looks up the name of a upgrade from the xws name provided by the squad builders.
pilotAliveDead - determines whether the pilot is still alive or dead.
